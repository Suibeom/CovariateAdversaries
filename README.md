# CovariateAdversaries

Neural networks can figure out what neural networks are thinking. So we'll use them to see if they're thinking about some covariate they shouldn't be thinking about, and use adverarial techniques to confound the gradient in those directions and interfere with the network's ability to learn these unwanted features.

The theoretical idea couldn't be simpler, and it seems to work just fine.
